Snake Game in Python

This is a classic implementation of the Snake game, created using Python. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food items to grow longer. The goal is to accumulate as much length as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

Features:
Snake Movement: The snake moves in four directions (up, down, left, right) using keyboard inputs.
Food: Randomly appearing food items that the snake must "eat" to grow.
Scoring: Each time the snake eats food, its length increases, and the score increments accordingly.
Game Over: The game ends if the snake hits the walls or its own body, displaying the final score.
Graphics: Simple and clean 2D graphics using the pygame library for smooth gameplay and visuals.
Libraries Used:
pygame: A Python library used for writing video games. It provides tools to handle graphics, sound, and game mechanics like movement and collision detection.
How to Play:
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snakeâ€™s movement.
Try to eat as much food as possible to grow the snake.
Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.
This game offers a fun and engaging way to practice basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and collision detection.

This description explains the general concept of the game, highlights the features, and mentions the library used to build it, making it suitable for documentation or a README file. You can adjust the description based on specific features you have implemented in your version.
